# starlings
An agent-based model and simulation of starling murmuration.

## Theory
The model is based overwhelmingly on the paper 'Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model' by H. Hildenbrandt C. Carere and C.K. Hemelrijka. It's available for free [here](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/6/1349/333856). (Wow, isn't Open Access academia lovely?)

## History
I made this as my project for MATH 437 Mathematical Methods in Biology at McGill University in the 2017 Winter Term with Aashna Uppal.

# What's here
The project was written in [Processing 3](https://processing.org/), which looks a lot like Java. It's also the language I first learnt to code in (thank you you great people!) I've included two folders.

## starlings_topology
This is the 'culmination' of the project and includes most of the features discussed in the paper above as well as a few (I feel) nicer implementations.

### To run
Download the most recent version of [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) and the rest will be plug-in and play.

## fish_sliders
This is a bonus to let you play with the 'social forces' of the agents: cohesion, separation and alignment. Without 'topological interaction', a key element of the starling simulation, the agents look more like fish.

### To run
Download the most recent version of [Processing 3](https://processing.org/) as well as a library called [Control5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/).
